# PDFTools

**An easy PDF toolset**

#### How to use

To use the program, just open the python or .exe file(which you can find on github) in the command prompt, you'll get this message:

```

Ver. [Version]

use 'help' for more info
>
```

This is where you can enter the commands:

- **info**, to get information about the document
- **merge**, to merge the selected documents
- **mergeOddEven**, to merge documents with 2 sides which have been scanned seperate
- **help**, to show the same information as here
- **quit**, to exit the program



*Note: I am not good good with GitHub and version control & stuff, so it might be a mess*
